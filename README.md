# 🩺 PCOS Data Analysis using Excel, Power Query, and DAX

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes real-world health data related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common but underdiagnosed hormonal disorder in women. By examining clinical and biological factors using Excel, this project aims to uncover trends and patterns that could support early diagnosis and raise awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patterns and correlations in PCOS-related health data.
- Understand how clinical variables (like BMI, age, hormone levels) relate to PCOS diagnosis.
- Build a clean, interactive dashboard summarizing key insights.
- Practice the complete data analysis process using **Excel**, **Power Query**, and **DAX**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Data Visualization
- **Power Query**
  - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
  - Data Cleaning (removing nulls, renaming, formatting)
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
  - Custom Measures for calculations and deeper insights
- **Star Schema**
  - Basic data modeling using one-to-many relationships

## 📌 Key Insights

- Women with **higher BMI** are more likely to be diagnosed with PCOS.
- The **20–34 age group** shows the highest number of diagnoses.
- **B+ and O+ blood groups** have a slightly higher occurrence of PCOS.
- PCOS-diagnosed women tend to have **elevated LH and PRL hormone levels**.

## 📈 Future Work
- Add more interactive features using Excel slicers.
- Explore similar analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Build the same dashboard in Power BI for comparison (optional).
- Apply classification models to predict PCOS likelihood.
